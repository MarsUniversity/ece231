# ECE 231

**ECE 231.** Electrical Circuits and Systems I. 3(1). An introduction to circuit analysis and
system design. Topics include circuit models of electrical devices and systems, nodal and mesh
analysis, Th√©venin and Norton equivalent circuits, dependent sources, operational amplifier
circuits, transient, sinusoidal, steady-state, and frequency response of first-order circuits (solution
of linear, first-order, constant coefficient, ordinary differential equations), and military and
civilian applications. Lab. Final exam. Prereq: Math 142. Sem hrs: 3 fall or spring.

## Setup OSX

Install `latex`:

```
brew cask install basictex
```

Put `handout.cls` and `DFEC-logo.png` in:

`/Users/<user name>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local/`

install `lastpage.stl`:

```
sudo tlmgr install lastpage
```

Might want to do:

```
sudo tlmgr update --all
```

## Setup Windows

1. Install `latex` from http://www.tug.org/downloads (install-tl-window.exe) which
is a Windows installation package:

2. Install `cmake` from https://cmake.org/download.

3. Install ImageMagick from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php.
I used the portable version x64 (near bottom of page) and put it in my Documents
folder. Then added it to the path:

```
export IMAGEMAGICK_CONVERT=/c/Users/Kevin.Walchko/Documents/ImageMagick-7.0.2-5-portable-Q16-x64
export PATH=/c/Users/Kevin.Walchko/Documents/ImageMagick-7.0.2-5-portable-Q16-x64:$PATH
```

## Build

This uses [`UseLATEX.cmake`](https://github.com/kmorel/UseLATEX) to build the
`.tex` files.

Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` variables to build the solution or not and also set
the output PDF diectory.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

Other useful `make` commands:

| Commands        | Description   |
| --------------- |:--------------|
| cmake nuke      | deletes everything in the build directory ... Nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. |
| cmake clean-pdf | deletes pdfs in output directory |
| cmake clean     | deletes some latex artifact files from the build directory |
| cmake copy      | copies pdfs to an output directory |

Since `cmake` copies everything into the `build` directory, you can safely delete
it.

## Misc

To remove spaces from file names:

```
for f in **/*; do mv -n "$f" `echo "$f" | sed -e 's/ /_/g'`; done
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work recursively all the way down, just down one level.
